> Flappy Bird gained immense popularity for its simple yet addictive gameplay and became a cultural phenomenon in the world of mobile gaming âœ¨ 

- Flappy Bird is is a popular 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. 
- The bird automatically moves forward, and the player by touching a screen or pressink a space key can make it flap its wings to gain upward momentum and avoid falling. 
- The game is challenging because the pipes have openings at different heights, requiring precise timing and control to pass through them. Each successful pass through a pipe earns the player a point, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible. 
- The game continues until the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, at which point the game is over.
